# My First Step in the Data Analysis world 
### This is my first Data Analysis Project, during my Nanodegree in DA with Udacity. 

The bikeshare.py file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous page will change! There are four questions that will change the answers:

1. **Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?**

2. **Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?**

3. **(If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?**

4. **(If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?**

If you have any questions or suggestions for improvements, tag me inyour discussion or contact me directly (See my profile), Thank you!
